<h3> Fielding </h3>    
    
<p> fielding is one of the 3 main parts to playing cricket so in a regular game of cricket you would have 11 players split into 1 bowler and 1 wicket keeper and the rest of the 9 players spread across the field. fielding is one of the most easiest parts to cricket because all you got to do is wait until the ball comes in and then you will throw the ball into the wicket keeper or bowler who will be behind the stumps and then the ball will end up going dead </p>
